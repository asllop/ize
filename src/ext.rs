//TODO: Plugins / Extensions
// Create a plugin system. These plugins will be used to implement the stdlib and user extensions.
// With the following features:
//  - Allow method overloading: define multiple functions for the same method name, each with a unique set of arguments.
//  - Allow linking a method to a native or user defined type.
//  - Allow argument and result validation (number and type), by registering a validator function. The semantic checker will just call this function.
